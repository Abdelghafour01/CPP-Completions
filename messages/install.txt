C++ Completions
===============

About
=====

  This Sublime Text (2 or 3) package gives method completion suggestions for C++.


How to Use
==========

  Methods and other completions
  """""""""""""""""""""""""""""
	Just type the words and the completion suggestions should show up. Press `ENTER` or `TAB` for completion.

  Including header files
  """"""""""""""""""""""
  	Type `i-`<header name> then Press `ENTER` or `TAB` for completion. e.g.

  	i-vector to get:
  	  #include <vector>

Note: For best result, you can disable (Qt Completions for C++) (if installed) so that only the normal C++ methods would show up in the completion lists.
